Interview Assignment for Android Position in Enparadigm weather

#Instructions
You'll make a simple Weather App for a given city. The app should be available offline and should give current weather, the forecast, and additional informations such as wind, pressure, humidity, etc.
You can use other libraries to speed up the development process and you should make regular commit (be sure to have proper commit comments).
Take the time you want (or can…) based on a good ratio between productivity and over-engineered product. Do not spend more than 2 days on that!!

iOS 13 & Swift
Android API 21 (5.0 Lollipop) Kotlin

Do not have just one big commit with everything in the porject.
